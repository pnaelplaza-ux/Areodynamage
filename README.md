# Areodynamage

First project I've made yet the project is to generate the aerodynamic of an image.

## About the Project
Aerodynamage is a creative and experimental project aimed at generating the "aerodynamic" properties of an image, blending creativity, physics, and technology. While this is my first project, it reflects my ambition to explore how coding can intersect with scientific visualization.

## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript** (73.7%) - Core logic and functionality
- **CSS** (15.6%) - Styling and layout
- **HTML** (10.7%) - Structure and content

## Future Improvements
For now, Aerodynamage is in its infancy, but here are some plans for growth:
- Add interactivity for users to upload their own images.
- Integrate data visualization tools like D3.js for clarity.
- Use external APIs or libraries for more realistic physics simulations.

## Contribution
Any ideas, suggestions, or collaborations are welcome! Feel free to fork the repo and submit a pull request.

This is the beginning of a learning journey, and I am excited to see where it goes next!
